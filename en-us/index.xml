&lt;h1 class="group " id="suicide"
>Suicide&lt;a href="#suicide"
>&lt;i class="eva eva-link ml-3 align-middle text-theme opacity-0 transition ease-in-out group-hover:opacity-100">&lt;/i>&lt;/a
>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I was on a bus, but I notice a friend is dead below the pedals of the bus, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see his face or see the complexion of the body (The body was inside of rad suit), but I read his note and says something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="quote relative pl-10 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">&lt;p>I got that new job, but I managed to screw all of the configuration for AWS and I&amp;rsquo;m seeing all error over and I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to fix it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This has been my fault and I don&amp;rsquo;t have any other option, I hope you going to understand.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>After reading that I assumed who is the person because was on a rad suit and I beging to call the 911 telling the situation. At this moment I see someone is driving the bus. This sutiation put us on movement so, I tell the people in the call where are moving and they can find us using the GPS of my phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After some blocks the police find us and began to take evidences of all the scene. Some woman of the police come to find me and ends the call which has been active with the 911, then she looks me in the eyes and tells me &amp;ldquo;how are you?&amp;rdquo; (They know the person dead is my friend), so I hug the police an beging to cry&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I woke up with some tears in my eyes, that was strange&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;fieldset class="my-16 border-t border-gray-300 dark:border-darkBorder">
&lt;legend class="mx-auto my-0 px-2">End of the dream&lt;/legend>
&lt;/fieldset>
&lt;p>To add some context on my situation, that day I had read a suicidal note from a person who kill himself. Also, in that week I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on some important configuration on my job. Also, that day I had some discoveries with my identity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think all of the situations had been mixed in a stressful day and this result in the dream.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
